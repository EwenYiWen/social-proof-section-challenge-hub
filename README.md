### What I learned

I have learned how to use CSS child selector to target specific element.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
 .rating-box:nth-child(1) {
    margin: 0px 80px 0px 0px;
  }
  .rating-box:nth-child(2) {
    margin: 0px 40px 0px 40px;
  }

  .rating-box:nth-child(3) {
    margin: 0px 0px 0px 80px;
  }
```

### Continued development

I would like to focus on understanding more about child selecting properties to properly target the specific element that i would like to make changes

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_nth-child.asp) - This helped me for the trouble to target the elements that i want to . I think this is a very useful tips to apply in the future.
